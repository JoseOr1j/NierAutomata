## Summary

I learned about how to use a web framework which will help serve for future projects. There are many frameworks that help with different things, with so many it is sometimes difficult to choose. Bootstrap served as a beginner friendly transition into using frameworks to speed up development time. I also learned more about how to make a responsive website with a good looking UI, and image sliders. Lastly I learned how to use an API, or *Application Programming Interface*. I used the Google Fonts API to change the fonts of my site to whichever ones looked best.
